# Gaia - The Web3 Github

## Introduction
Gaia is a Web3 platform that brings sustainable infrastructure to open source projects through token engineering. Inspired by nature's ecosystems, we use tokens as value carriers (like seeds) to engage users and help projects thrive organically.

## Vision
Empower open source projects with sustainable infrastructure. Like the fertile goddess ***Gaia***, we provide the foundation for creations to thrive.

### Why Web3 GitHub?
Traditional GitHub (Web2) faces fundamental limitations:
- **Centralized Control**: Single entity governs platform rules and content
- **Limited Incentives**: No native value exchange for contributors
- **Vulnerability**: Single point of failure for project ecosystems

Gaia solves these through Web3 principles:
- **Automatic**: Smart contracts automate governance and payouts, ensuring transparent execution without intermediaries
- **Incentives**: Native token rewards for contributions, creating sustainable economic alignment between users and projects
- **Transparency**: Not only public issues, PRs and discussions, token flows show how value moves through the ecosystem.
- **Censorship-resistant**: Censorship-resistant repositories with permanent availability
- **True Ownership**: Community maintain control through smart contracts.
